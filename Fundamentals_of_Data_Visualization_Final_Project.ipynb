       "<p><h3>As part of the second set of visualizations below, these included two heatmaps, with one representing patients without heart disease and the other heatmap representing patients with heart disease. This set of heatmaps utilizes a divergent color scale to not only show maximum heartrates for each patient, but to also provide an overview and high density of common heartrate levels for patients of a given gender and age group. Entries in both heatmaps that appear to be white indicate that there was no recorded entry for a patient of that given gender and age. While there has been much debate on whether or not maximum heartrate is a reliable indicator of heart disease, extremely high or low maximum heartrates have still been proven dangerous. According to an **article released by Harvard Health Publishing of Harvard Medical School, people who have a low maximum heartrate are at a higher risk of experiencing a heart attack or even death. </h3></p><p><h3>The highest maximum heartrate on average is considered to by 200 bpm (beats per minute). That knowledge lead to further analysis, which revealed that only one patient had a maximum heartrate above 200 bpm, who was a 29-year-old male patient without heart disease. The heatmap visualizations led to the following conclusions (despite how insightful these conclusions were, they did not show any relevant patterns related to heart disease nor confirmed if maximum heartrate levels are a reliable indicator of heart disease): 1.) higher maximum heartrate levels were found in patients without heart disease, 2.) for patients without heart disease, the greatest density of high maximum heartrate levels appear to be for patients between ages of 28 and 56, and 3.) only one patient (male patient of age 29, and without heart disease) was found to have a maximum heartrate above 200 bpm. However, the actual maximum heartrate (202 bpm) was relatively close and not significantly higher.</h3></p>"

    "HTML('<p><h3>As part of the second set of visualizations below, these included two heatmaps, with one representing patients without heart disease and the other heatmap representing patients with heart disease. This set of heatmaps utilizes a divergent color scale to not only show maximum heartrates for each patient, but to also provide an overview and high density of common heartrate levels for patients of a given gender and age group. Entries in both heatmaps that appear to be white indicate that there was no recorded entry for a patient of that given gender and age. While there has been much debate on whether or not maximum heartrate is a reliable indicator of heart disease, extremely high or low maximum heartrates have still been proven dangerous. According to an **article released by Harvard Health Publishing of Harvard Medical School, people who have a low maximum heartrate are at a higher risk of experiencing a heart attack or even death. </h3></p><p><h3>The highest maximum heartrate on average is considered to by 200 bpm (beats per minute). That knowledge lead to further analysis, which revealed that only one patient had a maximum heartrate above 200 bpm, who was a 29-year-old male patient without heart disease. The heatmap visualizations led to the following conclusions (despite how insightful these conclusions were, they did not show any relevant patterns related to heart disease nor confirmed if maximum heartrate levels are a reliable indicator of heart disease): 1.) higher maximum heartrate levels were found in patients without heart disease, 2.) for patients without heart disease, the greatest density of high maximum heartrate levels appear to be for patients between ages of 28 and 56, and 3.) only one patient (male patient of age 29, and without heart disease) was found to have a maximum heartrate above 200 bpm. However, the actual maximum heartrate (202 bpm) was relatively close and not significantly higher.</h3></p>')"

    "HTML('<p><h3>After focusing on the results from the previous visualizations, the decision was made to transform the data further to focus only on patients who have high cholesterol levels and high blood pressure. The heatmaps shown below reveal some interesting commonalities of both attributes, when compared between the results for patients with heart disease and patients without heart disease. From both sets of visualizations related to cholesterol as well as extended analysis, the following conclusions were made: 1.) male patients are more likely to have high cholesterol and high blood pressure than female patients, 2.) high cholesterol is mostly to be found in patients who have a blood pressure of 130 mmHg or 140 mmHg (in both heart disease patients and patients without heart disease), and 3.) the highest concentration of patients (with heart disease and without heart disease) are found to be between the ages of 30 and 77 (with outliers being in the late 20s for patients without heart disease).</h3></p>')"
